To start the program in Windows, open a command line and navigate to \Ramija. Execute the command
"java -jar Ramija.jar" to begin.

Alternatively, open the project in eclipse and hit the "Run"-Button.

WARNING:
This program could take a long time to run. Progress will be shown in the console, but depending 
on your hardware, an execution time of multiple hours is possible. This is mainly due to the large 
size of the data sets.
